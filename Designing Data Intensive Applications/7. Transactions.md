In data systems many things can go wrong :
- The database software or hardware may fail at any time (including middle of the operation);
- The application may crash at any time (including halfway through a series of operations);
- Interruptions in network can unexpectedly cut off application from the database or one node from another;
- Several clients may write to the database at the same time, overwriting each other's changes;
- A client may read data that doesn't make sense because it has only partially been updated;
- Race conditions between clients can cause surprising bugs;

For decades *transactions* have been the mechanism for dealing with such issues. A transaction is way for an application to group several reads or writes together into a logical unit. Entire transaction can either succeed (*commit*) or fail (*abort, rollback*). If it fails, application can safely retry and also we don't need to worry about partial failure scenarios. Using transactions means that the database takes care of potential error scenarios and concurrency issues. (*safety guarantees*)

### The Meaning of ACID

The safety guarantees provided by transactions are often described by the well-known acronym *ACID*, which stands for *Atomicity*, *Consistency*, *Isolation*, *Durability*. However, in practice the implementation of ACID in one database does not to an implementation in another database.

- **Atomicity** - in ACID atomicity describes what happens if a client wants to make several writes, but a fault occurs after some of the writes have been processed - for example, a process crashes, a network connection is interrupted, a disk becomes full or some integrity constrain is violated. If writes cannot be completed when they are grouped in an atomic transaction, and the transaction cannot be completed, then transaction is aborted and the database must discard or undo any writes it has made so far in that transaction.
- **Consistency** - in ACID, consistency is that you have certain statements about your data (*invariants*) that must always be true. If a transaction starts with a database that is valid according to the invariants, and any writes during the transaction preserve the validity, then you can be sure that the invariants are always satisfied. Consistency is a property of an application, rather than database and it's applications responsibility to form transactions that do not violate these invariants. Thus the letter *C* doesn't really belong in ACID.
- **Isolation** - in ACID means that concurrently executing transactions are isolated from each other : they cannot step of each other's toes. Classic database textbooks formalize isolation as *serializability*., which means that each transaction can pretend that is is the only transaction running on the entire database. The database ensures that when the transactions have committed, the result is the same as if they had run *serially* (one after another), even though they might have run concurrently. However, in practice, serializable isolation is rarely used, because it carries a performance penalty.
- **Durability** - in ACID is a promise that once the transaction has committed, any data it has written will not be forgotten, even if there's a hardware fault or the database crashes. In replicated database durability means that the data has been successfully copied to some number of nodes. In order to provide durability guarantee, a database must wait until these writes or replications are complete before reporting a transaction as successfully committed. In reality there are no technique that guarantees absolute durability of data. There are only various risk-reduction techniques like writing to disk, replication and backups.


### Single-Object and Multi-Object Operations

If one transaction reads another transaction's uncommitted writes, we call that a *dirty read*.

Single-object writes can get tricky when we write a lot of data during a single write. What happens if database crashes during the operation? Usually database provides atomicity and isolation for such operations. *Compare-and-set* operations allow a write to only happen if the value has not been concurrently changed by someone.

Reasons why sometimes we need writes to several different objects to be coordinated :
- In relational data model one table often has a foreign key reference to a row in another table. Multi-object transactions allow you to unsure that these references remain valid.
- In a document database, fields that are needed to be updated are often the in same document. In this case no transactions are needed. However, when dealing with multiple documents, since document databases encourage denormalized data, we need to make sure to update these documents in one go. In that case transactions are very useful.
- In databases with secondary indexes, the indexes also need to be updated when changing value. These indexes are different objects from transaction's point of view : without transaction isolation, it's possible for a record to appear in one index, but not another, because update to another index hasn't happened yet.

A key feature of a transactions is that they can be aborted and retried safely. If database detects that the transaction can violate guarantee of atomicity, durability or isolation, it would rather abort the transaction.

DDIA talks a little bit about error handling after aborted transactions. It recommends to retrying transactions after transient errors (deadlocks, network issues), author mentions that there has to be at least some deduplication issues in place if for example transaction actually succeeded, but there was a network issue between client and server, which resulted in application not getting acknowledgement from the server.


### Weak isolation levels

Concurrency issues only occur when transactions read data that is concurrently modified by another transaction or when two transactions try to modify the same data at the same time. Databases try to hide concurrency issues from application by providing *transaction isolation* .*Serializable* isolation has performance issues, therefore databases try to provide weaker isolation guarantees that guard against *some* concurrency issues.

#### Read-committed

The most basic level of transaction isolation is *read-committed*. It makes two guarantees :
1. When reading from the database, you will only see data that is committed (no *dirty reads*. )
2. When writing to the database you will only overwrite data that has been committed (no *dirty writes*)

No dirty reads is a useful guarantee because :
- If a transaction needs to update several objects, a dirty read means that another transaction may see some of the updates but no others. Seeing the database in a partially updated state is confusing to users and may cause other transactions to take incorrect decisions.
- If a transaction aborts, any writes it has made need to be rolled back. If database allows dirty reads, that means a transaction may see data that is later rolled back.

In most of the databases no dirty writes guarantee is usually implemented by locking. In order to write a value to a row, a transaction most acquire a lock and only the transaction that has the the lock can update the row. 
Dirty reads guarantee, however, does not scale well with locks. Since in case of a long-writing transaction all of the reading transactions are blocked. Therefore, most implementations save both old and new values. If another transaction wants to read the value, it is just served and old value.

#### Snapshot Isolation and Repeatable Road

Superficially it may seem that repeatable read guarantees everything that a transaction may require, it is still subject to subtle bugs like *read skew*. (DDIA page 237 has really good graphic and it's tricky to explain race conditions). E.g. Imagine Alice has $1,000 savings at a bank, split across two accounts with $500 each. Now a transactions transfers $100 from one of her accounts to the other. If she is unlucky enough to look at her list of account balance in the same moment as that transaction is being processed, she may see one account balance at a time before the incoming payment has arrived, and other after outgoing transfer has been made. For Alice, it now appears as if she has $900, she has lost $100. If Alice would read the balances again, after the transaction, the first account would have $600. This is an example of *non-repeatable read*.

Even though this is a transient problem, in some cases this is not acceptable :
- Backups - taking backup requires making a copy of an entire database. During that time writes will continue coming in and some parts of backup main contain and older version of the data, other parts - an older version. If you need to restore from backup, these inconsistencies will become permanent.
- Analytical queries - sometimes you want to run analytical queries or integrity checks that ensure that everything is in order. These queries are likely to return nonsensical results if they observe parts of the database at different points in time.

*Snapshot isolation* is the most common solution to this problem. The idea is that each transaction reads from a *consistent snapshot* of the database and it's very useful for long-running read-only queries such a backups.

Like read-committed snapshot isolation uses locks to prevent dirty writes. Key principle is that *readers never block writers, and writers never block readers*. The database must potentially keep several different committed version on an object, because various in-progress transactions may need to see the state of the database at different points in time. Because it maintains different version of an object side by side, this technique is known as *multi-version concurrency control*. Database that support snapshot isolation typically use MVCC for their read committed isolation level as well. A typical approach is that read committed uses a separate snapshot for each query, while snapshot isolation uses the same snapshot for an entire transaction. (DDIA page 240 for graphic of MVCC implementation)

By carefully defining visibility rules, databases are able to able to implement consistent snapshot isolation. This works as follows :
1. At the start of the transaction, the database makes a list of all other transactions that are in progress (not committed or aborted) at that time. Any writes that those transactions have made are ignored, even if the transactions subsequently commit.
2. Any writes made by aborted transactions are ignored.
3. Any writes made by transactions with later *transaction ID* (which started after the current transaction has started) are ignored, regardless of what those transactions have committed.
4. All other writes are visible to the application's queries.

An object is visible if both if the following conditions are true :
- At the time when the reader's transaction started, the transactions that created the object had already committed.
- The object is not marked for deletion, or if it is, the transaction that requested deletion had not yet committed at the time when the reader's transaction started.

A long running transaction may continue using a snapshot for a long time, continuing to read values that from other transactions point of view have long been overwritten or deleted. By never updating the values in place but instead creating a new version every time a value is changed, the database can provide a consistent snapshot while incurring only a small overhead.

Some databases call *snapshot isolation* as *repeatable read*.

### Preventing lost updates

Read committed and snapshot isolation levels are primarily focused about the guarantees of what a read-only transaction can see in the presence of concurrent writes. This issue occur during *read-modify-write cycle*. When two concurrently writing transaction update a value and second write does not include the first modification.

One solution is atomic operations, e.g.

```sql
UPDATE counters SET value = value + 1 WHERE key = 'foo';
```

Atomic operations are usually implemented by taking an exclusive lock on the object when it is read so that no other transaction can read it until the update has been applied. This technique is known as *cursor stability*. Another solution is to make atomic operations to be executed on a single-thread. ORMs make it especially easy to write code that performs read-modify-write cycles instead of using atomic operations provided by the database.

If database doesn't provide a sufficient atomic operation, it is possible to add a lock explicitly and then perform certain logic.

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

SELECT * FROM figures
	WHERE name ='robot' and game_id = 222
	FOR UPDATE;
-- Check whether move is valid, then update the position
-- of the piece returned by previous select
UPDATE figures SET position = 'c4' WHERE id = 1234;

COMMIT;
```

Some databases e.g. PostgreSQL has automatic lost update detection and abort offending transactions.

Sometime databases that don't implement transactions offer compare-and-set atomic operations, for example :

```sql
UPDATE wiki_pages SET content = 'new content'
WHERE id = 1234 and content = 'old_content'
```

You need to check how your database handles such operation. If this operation can read from old snapshot, this operation will overwrite the current change that was concurrently written by other transaction.

Preventing lost updates takes on another dimension. As discussed before when there are multi-leader and leaderless replication setups, conflicts can occur and there are various conflict resolution techniques. Most databases resolve conflicts by LWW strategy which is prone to data loss.

### Write skew and phantoms

*Write skew* is a race-condition when two concurrent writes read some data and update different objects in such a way incorrect database state is reached. An example two doctors booking time off, when at least one doctor must be on-call. If database evaluates `on_call` condition an the same time and proceeds to update `on_call` status, we might end up with a situation that no doctors are on-call. (DDIA page 247) 

It is neither dirty write , nor lost update because transactions modify different objects. 

Preventing write skew is quite complicated  :
- Atomic single-object operations don't help, as multiple objects are involved.
- Automatic detection of lost updates that you find in the implementation of snapshot isolation, don't help either. Automatically preventing write skew requires true serializable isolation.
- Some databases allow you to configure constraints, which are then enforced by database (e.g. uniqueness, foreign key constraints, or restrictions to a particular value). Most databases do not have constraints that involve multiple objects.
- If you can't use serializable isolation, another option is to explicitly lock all the rows that transaction depends on :

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

SELECT * FROM doctors
WHERE on_call = true
AND shift_id = 1234 FOR  UPDATE;

UPDATE doctors
SET on_call = false
WHERE name = 'Alice'
AND shift_id = 1234;

COMMIT;
```

Write skew generally follows this scenario :
1. Application uses *SELECT* statement, to check a requirement;
2. Depending on the result of the query application decides to proceed or abort;
3. If application decides to go ahead, it makes a write *INSERT* or *UPDATE*.

In case where we check for the *presence* of some rows, e.g. doctors on call, locking rows is can be done with *FOR UPDATE* statement. However, there are cases when want to check for the *absence* of some rows, then lock cannot be accomplished because during the initial SELECT statement there are no rows present to be locked. This type of write skew in called a *phantom*. Snapshot isolation avoids phantoms only in read-only queries.

In case of phantoms there is no row to attach lock to. In order to solve this problem, we can use technique called *conflict materialization*. In an example, where have a meeting room booking application (DDIA page 249), we can create a table with all of the possible meeting room time slots and use that table for lock acquisition. A note is that we won't store any data in that row, but use it only as a mechanism to allow is to provide a lock to our transactions. Generally, it is only a last-resort technique, because letting concurrency control mechanisms to leak into applications data-model is not a good decision. Serializable isolation level is much more preferred.
