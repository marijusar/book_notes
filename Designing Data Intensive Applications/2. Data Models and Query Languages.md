### SQL

Relational data model : 
-  Data is organised into relations, called *tables*.
-  Each relation is an unordered collection of *tuples* *(rows)*.

In a relational database query optimiser decides which parts of the query to execute in which order and which indexes to use.
### NoSQL
- NoSQL should be interpreted as "Not only SQL".

Driving forces behind NoSQL : 
- A need for greater scalability than relational databases can easily achieve, including very large datasets or very high write throughput.
- A widespread preference for free and open source software over commercial database products;
- Specialised query operations that are not well supported by the relational model;
- Frustration with the restrictiveness of relational schemas, and a desire for a more dynamic and expressive data model.

**Polyglot persistence** - when SQL databases are used alongside NoSQL.

**Impedance mismatch** - most applications are developed in OOP languages nowadays, therefore we need a translation layer that would translate the entities into relational structure.

JSON representation has better *locality*, than the multi-table schema. This avoids multiple queries (n + 1 (?)) or joins.

The advantage of using and **id** is useful because it has no meaning for humans, therefore it doesn't need to change. Anything that has meaning to humans may change in the future and all of it's copies will need to get updated. This incurs risk of write overheads and inconsistencies, where some of the information is updated, but other isn't. Removing such duplication is the key idea behind *normalisation*.

Document databases offer worse support for many-to-one and many-to-many relationships.

It's a good idea to use document databases when data model represents a tree of one-to-many relationships, where typically the entire tree is loaded at once.

*Shredding* - technique of splitting document-like structure into multiple tables can lead to cumbersome schemas and unnecessary code.

**Choosing document database where data model consists of many-to-many relationships often moves complexity into application code.**

Schema flexibility : 
- Schema-on-write, where structure of data model is enforced during the write. Relational databases.
- Schema-on-read, where structure of data model is enforced during the read. Document databases.
